Flappy Bird Game (Python + Pygame)

Project Overview:
This project was undertaken as a part of my internship at CodeClause, and it's a recreation of the iconic Flappy Bird game using Python and the Pygame library. Building this game was a delightful journey that involved physics simulation, game logic, and interactive gameplay elements.

Key Features:
Flap to Soar: Control the bird by tapping to make it fly higher and navigate through pipes.
Score Tracking: The game keeps count of the number of pipes successfully passed.
Collision Detection: When the bird collides with a pipe, the ground, or the sky, the game ends, and the final score is displayed.
Restart Functionality: To start a new game, simply press the Enter key or rerun the game.

Gameplay:
The objective is to navigate the bird through the openings between pipes.
Each successful passage through a pair of pipes adds to the player's score.
The game continues until the bird collides with an obstacle or reaches the sky/ground.
The final score is displayed, and players can easily restart the game for another round of fun.

Project Goals:
Recreate the Flappy Bird game with faithful gameplay mechanics.
Implement scoring and collision detection for a challenging gaming experience.
Explore Pygame library for 2D game development in Python.

Learning Outcomes:
Mastery of Pygame library for game development.
In-depth understanding of physics simulation in games.
Experience in game logic implementation, scoring, and collision detection.
Problem-solving skills honed through overcoming various gaming challenges.

How to Play:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the Python script flappy_bird.py to start the game.
Control the bird by tapping the spacebar to avoid pipes and increase your score.
Press Enter to restart the game.

Dependencies:
Python (3.0 recommended)
Pygame library
